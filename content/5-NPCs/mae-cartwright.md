**Faction/Organization:** N/A<br>
**Role:** Tavern owner<br>
**Primary Location:** [Gendron's Post](gendrons-post)

Mae Cartwright is the proprietor of the Rusty Spur tavern.

**Personality:** Mae has the calm demeanor of a woman who has seen it all, from rowdy goatherds to desperate travelers looking for solace. She is always ready to provide a comforting smile or a scathing reprimand to anyone who steps out of line.

**Appearance:** Mae is in her mid-50s and carries herself with a quiet dignity. She is the calm center in the otherwise raucous Rusty Spur. She keeps her silver-streaked hair neatly pinned up, and her sharp eyes miss nothing that happens in her establishment.
