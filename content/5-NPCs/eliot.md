**Faction/Organization:** N/A<br>
**Role:** Boy about town<br>
**Primary Location:** [Gendron's Post](gendrons-post)

Eliot is a Scour orphan. [Jane Gendron](jane-gendron) found him as a two- to three-year-old in the aftermath of the second Scour event in year 31 (1855 DE). He's been living with her ever since.

**Personality:** Eliot has grown up right along side of Gendron's Post. He is fiercely loyal to Jane, but he wants desperately to be independent and not to rely on anyone. He is relentlessly mercenary when it comes to money in the way that only a 12-year-old can be. He hopes to buy himself passage off WhakatƒÅne someday on a [Wayfinders' Union](the-wayfinders-union) ship.

**Appearance:** Eliot is a slim young boy with tousled, sandy brown hair that he frequently brushes back from large, brown eyes. He wears faded corduroy and a denim shirt. He carries a small satchel slung cross-body and keeps a slingshot tucked in his belt at the small of his back.
