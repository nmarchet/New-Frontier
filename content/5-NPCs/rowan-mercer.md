**Faction/Organization:** [The Resistance Movement](the-resistance-movement.md)<br>
**Role:** Lead Propagandist

Rowan was 6 years old when his ship, Golden Wave, was forced into the Seas of Chaos. He doesn’t remember much, but he remembers the fear in his mothers eyes as she lashed him to a stanchion. He remembers how cold the wave was that washed over them and tore his mother away from him. Even before the arrival of the Wayfinders’ Union, Rowan spoke on corners and distributed handwritten pamphlets—anything he could think of to make sure everyone else remembered the injustice and the horror of the Sovereign Mercantile Council’s judgment too.

**Personality:** Rowan is shy and awkward, but, when he speaks of justice for the exiled people of Whakatāne, he is overcome with a fiery determination. He becomes eloquent and inspiring.

**Appearance:** Average height with short brown hair, hazel eyes and a scar near his left eye—a souvenir from an altercation with Haven Syndicate agents. Rowan dresses in simple, functional clothing and carries a satchel full of pamphlets and notes.
