**Faction/Organization:** [Thalasson's Chosen](thalassons-chosen.md)
**Role:** Street Preacher

Gideon is the most charismatic and well-known of the street preachers calling for a return to belief in the [Elemental Trinity](elemental-trinity.md). He has drawn many settlers back to the traditional faith, creating a strong core of believers who view him as a spiritual guide—all while protesting that he’s no leader. His influence has ramped up tensions with nonbelievers and spiritualists, making him both a revered figure and a source of concern for the authorities.

**Personality:** Gideon is articulate and persuasive, with a magnetic zeal that captivates his audience. Despite his fervor, he is also known for his compassion and genuine concern for the well-being of his followers. Gideon is relentless in his mission, often seen preaching from dawn until dusk.

**Appearance:** Tall and lean with stringy, dirty blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. Gideon has a weathered, angular face with high cheekbones. He dresses in simple robes that are meant to invoke the ancient prophets and wears carved wooden sandals.
