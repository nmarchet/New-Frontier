Lydia Marlowe was the one who proposed the route by which Captain Windrider and the Stormbreaker circumnavigated the Seas of Chaos and (re)discovered WhakatƒÅne.

**Personality:** Lydia is methodical and precise, with a passion for discovery that drives her work. She has an analytical mind and can be reserved and introspective, but she is always willing to share her knowledge with others.

Lydia wears practical and durable clothing, typically including a long coat with pockets for her tools and maps, sturdy boots and a wide-brimmed hat to keep the glare of the sun from interfering with her work.
