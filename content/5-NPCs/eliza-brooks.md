**Faction/Organization:** N/A<br>
**Role:** Tavern owner<br>
**Primary Location:** [Gendron's Post](gendrons-post)

Jeb Cartwright works for his mother, [Mae Cartwright](mae-cartwright), as the bouncer for the Rusty Spur tavern.

**Personality:** Jeb is kind-hearted and easy-going, with a knack for making people feel at ease. His  charm hides a more serious side  that emerges when he's performing his duties as the tavern's bouncer. Heâ€™s fiercely loyal to his mother and the Rusty Spur, always putting their needs first.

**Appearance:** Jeb is a young man with curly brown hair and bright, hazel eyes. He is deceptively strong with a solid frame, and he's taller than one would think at glance.
