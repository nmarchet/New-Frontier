**Faction/Organization:** N/A<br>
**Role:** Panacea healer<br>
**Primary Location:** [Gendron's Post](gendrons-post)

Eliza Brooks was dispatched from [Panacea](panacea) headquarters in [Fairhaven](fairhaven) to establish a clinic at the rapidly growing settlement of Gendron's Post.

**Personality:** Eliza does not have the best bedside manner. Her patients often endure sarcastic asides or outright lectures about primitive home remedies or untimely treatment of an illness. Eliza is also serious, pragmatic and fiercely independent, and these are the qualities that earned her the daunting task of establishing the new clinic.

**Appearance:** Eliza is a woman in her late thirties, with wavy red hair. Streaks of gray are beginning to show at her temples. Her pale skin contrasts with her sharp, dark eyes that seem to miss nothing, giving her an air of constant consternation. Eliza dresses in practical, earth-toned clothing, usually wearing an apron filled with herbs and the tools of her trade.
