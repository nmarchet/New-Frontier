**Faction/Organization:** [The Wayfinders' Union](the-wayfinders-union.md)<br>
**Role:** Captain and Expedition Leader<br>
**Primary Location:** [Port J](port-j)

Captain Windrider made history by leading her crew on the first successful circumnavigation of the Seas of Chaos. While her arrival in Port J was a significant achievement in its own right, the ensuing trade agreements Captain Windrider negotiated were, perhaps, even more momentous for Whakatāne and the outside world.

**Personality:** Captain Windrider is determined and ambitious and known for her strategic mind. She is deeply loyal to her crew, often putting their welfare above her own.

**Appearance:** Tall with a commanding presence, piercing blue eyes and a mane of silver hair that she often wears in a loose when ashore. She bears a number of scars from her numerous voyages, including a jagged mark running down her right forearm. Even at sea, Captain Windrider’s attire is practical yet elegant, often consisting of a dark, weather-resistant coat adorned with the compass rose of the Wayfinders' Union and sturdy leather boots.
