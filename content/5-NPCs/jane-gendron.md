Jane Gendron is the founder of Gendron’s Post.

**Personality:** Jane has the air of someone accustomed to both offering suggestions and giving commands—and having both followed attentively followed.

**Appearance:** Jane is a middle-aged woman with long, salt-and-pepper hair that she keeps tied back in braids. She wears practical and well-kept work clothes and a gun belt with two pistols slung low on her hips. She keeps her hat tipped down most of the time to block the sun.
