Marcus Stone owns and operates the the town's workshop and forge.

**Personality:** Marcus is calm and patient. He doesn't speak much, but when he does, his words carry weight. People in the settlement respect him for his skills, but also rely on him for advice.

**Appearance:** Marcus is a tall, imposing figure with broad shoulders and thick arms, honed from years of hard labor at the forge. His weathered face is framed by a full, graying beard. Kind eyes seem to take in everything around him. Marcus wears a leather apron over his work shirt. The sleeves of his shirt are always rolled up, and the pockets of his apron are filled with well-worn files and other tools.
