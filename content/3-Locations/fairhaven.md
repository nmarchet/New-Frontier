Built on the shore of the Salas River delta, Fairhaven is the first permanent settlement founded by the survivors of the exiled House Velyra. It began as a smattering of shacks and lean-tos cobbled together from their beached derelict ships, but now it’s the hub of a larger, well-established colony. Now, most of the main streets are even paved with granite scraps from the mines of Scotsglen.

# Notable Buildings
**Civic Hall.** Once the Second Chance Saloon, this building now serves as the heart of Fairhaven’s government. The [People’s Council](the-peoples-council) meets here to make decisions and oversee the administration of the colony.

**Panacea Clinic.** A center for medical research and treatment. In addition to treating Fairhaven’s sick and wounded, [Panacea's](panacea) clinic is a research center and a base of operations for the healers and botanists who study the island’s unique flora and fauna in hopes of developing new medicines and treatments.

**Tyrl’s Terrible Lizards.** Tyrl Danforth is the son of Betsy Danforth, who first domesticated hadrosaurs. He has continued his mother’s work at a large ranch just outside of Fairhaven where he raises, sells and rents the unusually large lizards. He also has trained and bred pigeon-size lizards called pterodactyls to carry messages between most of the colony’s settlements.
# Major Landmarks
**Market Square.** The bustling center of trade in Fairhaven. Farmers, fishers and artisans gather here to sell their goods. It’s a lively place where goods are sold, news is exchanged and street-corner philosophers and preachers hold forth.

**Station Plaza.** Two train lines connect Fairhaven to [Kapama](kapama) and to [Port J](port-j). The terminal at Station Plaza has none of the grandiose architecture of the train stations back in Rosslyn and very little of the amenities. There is an open-air passenger platform and a second platform in a nearby warehouse to facilitate the transfer and temporary storage of cargo. There are several sidings nearby and a wheelhouse to reverse incoming steam engines for return trips.

**Fairhaven Harbor.** Although Port J acts as the main gateway to Whakatāne for most [Wayfinders’ Union](the-wayfinders-union) ships, the harbor at Fairhaven has expanded to offer berths for the Union ships that do dock here. There is also a new shipyard on one of the river delta’s islands where shipwrights and riggers are building Whakatāne’s first oceangoing vessel under the direction of a Union architect. 
# Lodging
**Settlers’ Rest Inn.** A popular lodging spot claiming to feature original timber from the founding ships. It offers comfortable accommodations and hearty meals.

**Wayfarer’s Refuge.** An inn that’s as upscale as possible for a colony on the edge of the world that caters to visiting Wayfinders’ Union members and wealthy traders.
