Gendron's Post is a fledgling settlement strategically located where the desert meets the fertile plains on the trail from [Sand Lake](sand-lake) to [Kapama](kapama). It was established as a rest and resupply station for those making that arduous journey. The settlement is named after its founder, [Jane Gendron](jane-gendron.md), a former merchant who recognized an opportunity to provide essential services and amenities and to ensure the safety and well-being of travelers and their goods.
# Notable Buildings
**Rest House.** The rest house is the largest building in Gendron’s Post. It offers lodging for travelers, with a handful of private rooms available as well as several dormitories that sleep four to 16 people. There is a communal dining area where meals are served during the day and cots are set out in the evenings. There is an office and living quarters for the proprietor, [Maggie Hargrove](maggie-hargrove), in the back.

**The Staging Yard.** A busy area where caravans are assembled and livestock is traded. It’s managed by a no-nonsense foreman named [Darren Smithson](darren-smithson), who oversees the flow of goods and people. A small tack room and office with attached living quarters is connected to two large paddocks—one for the hadrosaurs that pull the wagons and the other for storing wagons and equipment. The later is also where caravan masters assemble their trains before departing.

**Repair Shop.** [Marcus Stone](marcus-stone) runs the town's workshop and forge, offering repairs for wagons, tools, equipment and more. At the heart of the shop, bellows stand ready to bring the forge's banked fire roaring back—often worked by his occasional apprentice, [Ella Wilson](ella-wilson-pascal). The blacksmith hammers away on the nearby anvil. Along the walls, hammers, tongs, wrenches and pliers hang from hooks. Shelves and storage bins contain bar stock, sheets of metal, wire and other raw materials. In the back room, broken items wait their turn at the forge and the blacksmith's hammer.

**Rusty Spur Tavern.** A large tavern for such a small settlement serves as the gathering place for locals as well as the regular caravans passing through. A crooked sign hanging out front with a rusted hadrosaur spur as part of its logo. There are a few mismatched chairs and barrels on the porch for those who prefer to drink outside. The proprietor, [Mae Cartwright](mae-cartwright), runs the place from behind the bar—a large, polished slab of oak from [Glendale](glendale). Her son, [Jeb Cartwright](jeb-cartwright), is the tavern's bouncer.

**General Store.** An unnamed, one-room establishment where travelers can purchase supplies, trade goods, and stock up on essentials before continuing their journey. The general store is run by husband and wife, Rufus and Maria O’Hare.

**Clinic.** A clean and orderly, single-room building with several cots for patients. The shelves are stocked with medicinal herbs and supplies. A folding screen cordons off living quarters for Eliza Brooks, the resident healer.

**Gendron’s Post.** The eponymous lookout tower at the heart of the settlement was built by Jane Gendron to watch for travelers and potential threats. A narrow trestle structure supports a small, one-room cabin with a ladder leading up to it. There’s a full-perimeter balcony that allows for clear views of the nearby countryside. Jane's ward, Eliot, is often on self-imposed lookout duty.

**The Well.** It’s a public well. Fresh water for 8 cents a bucket—a vital resource so close to the desert. Sometimes it is manned by Jane Gendron's young ward, Eliot, but usually a former deputy sheriff named [Dakota Hicks](herbert-hicks) watches the well.
