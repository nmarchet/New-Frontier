Gendron's Post is a fledgling settlement strategically located where the desert meets the fertile plains on the trail from [Sand Lake](sand-lake) to [Kapama](kapama). It was established as a rest and resupply station for those making that arduous journey. The settlement is named after its founder, Jane Gendron, a former merchant who recognized an opportunity to provide essential services and amenities and to ensure the safety and well-being of travelers and their goods.
# Notable Buildings

**Repair Shop.** An unnamed workshop offering repairs for wagons, tools and equipment.

**Rusty Spur Tavern.** A large tavern for such a small settlement, but it serves as the gathering place for locals as well as the regular caravans resupplying before they pass through.

**General Store.** An unnamed, one-room establishment where travelers can purchase supplies, trade goods, and stock up on essentials before continuing their journey.

**Gendron’s Post.** The lookout tower at the heart of the settlement was built by Jane herself to watch for travelers and potential threats.
