Gendron's Post is a fledgling settlement strategically located where the desert meets the fertile plains on the trail from [Sand Lake](sand-lake) to [Kapama](kapama). It was established as a rest and resupply station for those making that arduous journey. The settlement is named after its founder, [Jane Gendron](jane-gendron), a former merchant who recognized an opportunity to provide essential services and amenities and to ensure the safety and well-being of travelers and their goods.
# Notable Buildings
**Rest House.** A sturdy building offering lodging for weary travelers, with simple but comfortable rooms and a communal dining area where meals are served.

**The Staging Yard.** A busy area where caravans are assembled and livestock is traded. It’s managed by a no-nonsense foreman named Darren Smithson, who oversees the flow of goods and people. A small tack room and office with attached living quarters is connected to two large paddocks—one for the hadrosaurs that pull the wagons and the other for storing wagons and equipment. The later is also where caravan masters assemble their trains before departing.

**Repair Shop.** An unnamed workshop offering repairs for wagons, tools and equipment.

**Rusty Spur Tavern.** A large tavern for such a small settlement, but it serves as the gathering place for locals as well as the regular caravans resupplying before they pass through.

**General Store.** An unnamed, one-room establishment where travelers can purchase supplies, trade goods, and stock up on essentials before continuing their journey.

**Clinic.** A clean and orderly, single-room building with several cots for patients. The shelves are stocked with medicinal herbs and supplies, and a folding screen cordons off the resident healer’s personal area.

**Gendron’s Post.** The eponymous lookout tower at the heart of the settlement was built by Jane Gendron to watch for travelers and potential threats. A narrow trestle structure supports a small, one-room cabin with a ladder leading up to it. There’s a full-perimeter balcony that allows for clear views of the nearby countryside.

**The Well.** It’s a public well. Fresh water for 8 CP a bucket—a vital resource so close to the desert.
