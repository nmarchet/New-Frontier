Kapama is located in the fertile grasslands between the Vein River and River Romul. Established just a few years into the settlement of Whakatāne, Kapama has grown into the colony's primary source of food and agricultural products. This thriving settlement is characterized by its vast expanses of farmland, where settlers grow a variety of crops—wheat, barley, corn, potatoes and various vegetables—and raise livestock—cows, sheep, goats and chickens—that sustain the colony. 
# Notable Buildings
**Agricultural Hall.** The headquarters for the local farming cooperative, where farmers gather to trade, discuss best practices and collaborate on large-scale projects. When it’s not in-use for meetings, the co-op rents out the hall for events—a major source of income for the co-op championed by the new president, John McMurray. However, President McMurray is very selective about which musical events are allowed to rent the hall. He is very insistent that “agricultural halls are for agricultural music.”

**Farmer’s Square Market.** The yard in front of the agricultural hall, where farmers gather on the weekend to sell their produce, livestock and homemade goods to locals and visitors from other settlements. 

**Kapama Dairy.** A facility where milk is mass-processed into cheese, butter and other dairy products.

**Panacea Clinic.** An outpost where Kapama residents can get regular healthcare. This [Panacea](panacea) clinic also is a base of operations for expeditions to the south. Promising samples are returned here to be packaged for transport to [Fairhaven](fairhaven).
# Major Landmarks
**Kapama Grain Silos.** Several large silos line the road to Fairhaven. They are used for storing grain and other crops before they are transported to other parts of the colony.

**Kapama Windmill.** An iconic structure used for grinding grain into flour. A recent visitor from the [Wayfinders’ Union](the-wayfinders-union) paid Old Man Eggers to attach all manner of equipment to the windmill’s drive shaft. He talked about generating something called electricity.

**Twin River Bridge.** A sturdy wooden bridge that spans the Vein River and River Romul where they merge just outside of Kapama. It makes a direct connection between Kapama and [Glendale](glendale) possible.
# Lodging
**The Harvest Inn.** A cozy inn near the center of Kapama that offers comfortable rooms and hearty meals made from local ingredients. It's a popular spot for travelers and visiting merchants.

**Campsites and barns.** For farmhands and laborers who can’t afford formal accommodations, there are designated campsites and barns on the outskirts of Kapama where travelers can pitch tents or sleep under the stars.
