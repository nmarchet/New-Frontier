Scotsglen is a bustling mining encampment located southwest of [Fairhaven](fairhaven), in the foothills of the Shards. It has grown from a rough-and-tumble hillside camp into an established settlement. Miners and mine owners live here for convenient access to the rich veins of iron ore and granite as well as copper, silver, gold and quartz crystals nearby. Scotsglen is also home to milling and smelting facilities. In fact, visitors can hear the relentless grinding and clanging of the mills and the refinery echo off neighboring mountain faces for miles before they can even see Scotsglen.

# Notable Buildings
**Scotsglen Mill and Smelting Works.** The [Consortium](the-consortium)-owned facility is used by multiple mine owners. Here, extracted ores are rough milled before they are sent to [Port J](port-j) and Fairhaven for refining. Some iron is smelted here too, and transported as ingots or basic tools instead of as ore.

**Granite House.** A large building constructed entirely from local granite and built into the mountainside where a drift from one of the settlement’s original mines didn’t pan out. It showcases the skill of Scotsglen’s masons and functions as the administrative center for the Silverpeak Mining Co.

**Assayers’ Office.** Independent miners can come to the assayer for an impartial assessment of their ore before selling it. The countertops and shelves in the office are chockablock with reference books, logs and all the tools needed to catalog, weigh and assess ore samples.
# Major Landmarks
**The Shards.** The mountain range dominates the landscape, with peaks often shrouded in mist. The Shards are both a source of wealth and a constant challenge, with their rugged terrain and hidden dangers.

**The Great Mine.** The largest and oldest of Scotsglen’s mines is owned by [Miranda Hawke](miranda-hawke) of the Silverpeak Mining Co. It is renowned for its depth and for the quality of its silver ore.
# Lodging
**The Miner’s Rest.** A modest establishment offering basic but comfortable lodging for transient workers and visiting traders.

**The Stonewall Tavern.** A popular spot for miners and locals, offering food, drink and a place to unwind. The tavern’s thick stone walls provide a cozy, secure atmosphere.
