Port J is a bustling harbor town located where the Shards meet the coastline west of [Fairhaven](fairhaven). It was first established to facilitate the transportation of ore and stone from the nearby [Scotsglen](scotsglen) mines. Since then, with the arrival of the [Wayfinders’ Union](the-wayfinders-union), Port J has become a vital commercial hub for Whakatāne and the island’s primary port. Today, the settlement—home of the business syndicate known as [the Consortium](the-consortium)—is a focus of intrigue and tensions with the government at Fairhaven.
# Notable Buildings
**Consortium Headquarters.** The central office for The Consortium, the influential business collective that controls the key mining, forestry and fishing industries in Whakatāne.

**Union Trading Post.** A small, fortified embassy established by the Wayfinders’ Union for trade and diplomacy.

**Customs House.** Representatives from the [People’s Council](the-peoples-council) of Fairhaven inspect, log and tax the goods that enter or leave the port.
# Major Landmarks
**The Lighthouse.** The tallest structure in Whakatāne guides ships safely into the harbor. It was designed by Wayfinders’ Union architects and built with granite from the mines in Scotsglen. Special lenses and an enormous polished brass mirror at the top catch light from the sun, the moons or the Caelean rings and reflect it out to sea. 

**The Market Square.** A bustling area where traders and merchants from across Whakatāne and beyond gather to buy and sell goods.

**Memorial Park.** A green space dedicated to the settlers who founded Port J and those lost in the journey through the Seas of Chaos.
# Lodging
**The Seaway Saloon.** A popular tavern known for hearty meals and inexpensive drinks, often frequented by sailors and traders.

**Captain’s Quarters Inn.** Probably the fanciest establishment in Whakatāne, with luxury accommodations to cater to visiting members of the Wayfinders’ Union.
