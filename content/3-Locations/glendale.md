Located on the edge of a vast forest just beyond Carrington Pass, which winds its way through to the other side of the Shards, Glendale is the smallest of the incorporated settlements. However, its position provides access to an essential natural resource—the lumber that made it possible for all other settlements to grow. The settlement is known for its serene, natural beauty and its close-knit community.
# Notable Buildings
**Community Hall.** The central building where residents gather for meetings and celebrations.

**Woodworking Shop.** Ezra Mitten runs this small workshop where he makes wooden furniture and other handcrafted goods.

**Forager's Hut.** A place where collected herbs and plants are processed and stored. Grace Tuttle, a former botanist from Panacea lives in the back and keeps the collection organized.
# Major Landmarks

**The Forest Path.** It began as a deer trail found by the original settlers of Glendale. Today, it’s a well-trod path that leads deep into the forest, and it’s used by hunters and foragers alike.

**Forest’s Edge Swap.** Traders and locals exchange goods at this perpetual swap meet, located outside the community hall.

**Stone Arch Gate.** The historical entrance to Glendale marks the end of the Carrington Pass through the Shards.
