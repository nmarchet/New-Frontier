Glenbour is a mystery in the most fundamental sense—most parts of the world remain unknown to the rest. For example, the inhabitants of Meredosia—the continent where our story begins—know very little about what lies beyond their own lands. So, like most folk, they see themselves at the center of the world. 

In this case, there is some truth to that belief as Meredosia does straddle Glenbour’s equator. However, the people of the continent know little of what lies beyond Meredosia—just the various islands off the coasts like Rosslyn and a handful of trading kingdoms across the Sunward Ocean. How far do those kingdoms stretch? What lies across the Western Ocean or beyond the perpetual hurricanes of the Seas of Chaos to the south? Has anyone made their way over the treacherous ice sheets that stretch across the North Sea to the icy wastes at the pole?

Most folks outside the Wayfinders’ Union don’t even ask the questions let alone have answers.
