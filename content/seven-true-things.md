**There is no magic.** Stage magicians may perform simple tricks to delight children or elaborate deceptions that baffle adults, but, in the end, everyone knows it's not real; it's just illusion. 

**There are no gods.** There are certainly stories about gods in the distant past, and religion does play a central role in the lives of many people, however no gods in modern memory have revealed themselves or had an obviously real effect on the world.

**Humans are the only sentient species.** Although, there are plenty of stories and folk tales about mischievous gnomes robbing unwary travelers or blind rock-whisperers living underground in elaborate caves systems.

**Most of the world remains unexplored.** Even the elaborate charts of the Wayfinders’ Union are less than half complete by their estimates.

**It is the dawn of a new technological age.** The [level of advancement](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/telephone-technology-timeline/) is that of the American west circa 1865-1900. It is more advanced than you would think, but the latest inventions and innovations are restricted to the moneyed class.

**The oligarchs of Rosslyn are continually at war.** Usually, it is a cold war of spying, political intrigue and economic manipulation. However, periodically fighting breaks out. The most recent of these civil wars was 40 years ago.

**A new land was recently discovered.** It’s a bountiful island with extraordinary natural resources and significant strategic potential. Only a select few who don’t live there know of its existence, but that could soon change.
