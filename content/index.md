# Welcome to Glenbour
The red sun looms large over the land and lends a slight orange tint to the sky. Sometimes during the day, you can see the faint outlines of one or both of Glenbour’s twin moons. However, you can always see the gossamer threads of the rings that encircle Glenbour’s equator and stretch from horizon to horizon.

At night, the Caelean rings—named for Caelus, god of the sky—catch and reflect the sun’s light in a brilliant display. It is such a vivid and dependable sight that navigators of the Wayfinders’ Union mark their ships’ positions and plot courses in reference to it. Periodically a Union navigator claims to have devised a purely lunar method of navigation, but none of those techniques have ever proved reliable.

One luminist from the College of Astronomy at the University of Aubrey in Manton authored a paper that attempts to explain the erratic path traced by the moons. She wrote, “With sufficient observation, it may well prove to be that as one moon orbits our terrestrial sphere so too does the other moon orbit the former.” That theory is not supported by most scholars of the field however.
# The Known World
Glenbour is a mystery in the most fundamental sense—most parts of the world remain unknown to the rest. For example, the inhabitants of Meredosia—the continent where our story begins—know very little about what lies beyond their own lands. So, like most folk, they see themselves at the center of the world. 

In this case, there is some truth to that belief as Meredosia does straddle Glenbour’s equator. However, the people of the continent know little of what lies beyond Meredosia—just the various islands off the coasts like Rosslyn and a handful of trading kingdoms across the Sunward Ocean. How far do those kingdoms stretch? What lies across the Western Ocean or beyond the perpetual hurricanes of the Seas of Chaos to the south? Has anyone made their way over the treacherous ice sheets that stretch across the North Sea to the icy wastes at the pole?

Most folks outside the Wayfinders’ Union don’t even ask the questions let alone have answers.

# Seven True Things
1. **There is no magic.** Stage magicians may perform simple tricks to delight children or elaborate deceptions that baffle adults, but, in the end, everyone knows it's not real; it's just illusion. 

2. **There are no gods.** There are certainly stories about gods in the distant past, and religion does play a central role in the lives of many people, however no gods in modern memory have revealed themselves or had an obviously real effect on the world.

3. **Humans are the only sentient species.** Although, there are plenty of stories and folk tales about mischievous gnomes robbing unwary travelers or blind rock-whisperers living underground in elaborate caves systems.

4. **Most of the world remains unexplored.** Even the elaborate charts of the Wayfinders’ Union are less than half complete by their estimates.

5. **It is the dawn of a new technological age.** The [level of advancement](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/telephone-technology-timeline/) is that of the American west circa 1865-1900. It is more advanced than you would think, but the latest inventions and innovations are restricted to the moneyed class.

6. **The oligarchs of Rosslyn are continually at war.** Usually, it is a cold war of spying, political intrigue and economic manipulation. However, periodically fighting breaks out. The most recent of these civil wars was 40 years ago.

7. **A new land was recently discovered.** It’s a bountiful island with extraordinary natural resources and significant strategic potential. Only a select few who don’t live there know of its existence, but that could soon change.
