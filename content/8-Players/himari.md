	<summary>Backstory | For the DM and the character's player only</summary>
	<p>Himari’s father, Daisuke, was a practitioner of kenjitzu, a martial art and philosophy practiced in the nation of Kamiah in the north of Meredosia. Service is a significant part of the philosophy, and Daisuke served as a soldier for House Velyra. He was exiled, along with the rest of the Velyra family and retainers, at the end of the War of the Houses.</p>
<p>In Whakatāne, Daisuke found himself with no master—an uncomfortable position for a practitioner of kenjitzu. So, he became an agent of the Haven Syndicate, an organization formed early on in the colony’s history to provide protection services in the lawless and often dangerous frontier of Whakatāne.</p>
<p>Eleven years later (Year 11 | 1835 DE), Daisuke was on an extended engagement for the Syndicate in Glendale, the colony’s newest and most distant settlement. There, Himari’s father reconnected with Aiko, another former retainer of House Velyra. Himari was born soon after.</p>
<p>Nearly two years after that (Year 13 | 1837 DE), Himari’s father was recalled to Fairhaven. Daisuke wanted to take his family back with him. But, when the time came to begin the journey back, Aiko was gone. She’d left in the night. She didn’t give a reason; she just left a note that said not to look for her.</p>
<p>Left alone to raise his son, Daisuke didn’t know how to parent, but he did know how to train. So, that’s what he did, and Himari grew up with more of a master than a father.</p>
<p>At age 16, he followed his father into service to the Haven Syndicate. But, things changed when he was 19 and his father died on a mission. Himari’s handler in the Syndicate refused to share any information about Daisuke’s death, which has always seemed suspicious to Himari.</p>
<p>That seed of unease grew into Himari’s singular focus: to find out the circumstances of his father’s death. So far, he has only been able to uncover the name of his father’s handler, Malcom (no last name).</p>
<p>After his father died, Himari left the Syndicate, but he is still an independent mercenary and regularly does contract work for the organization.</p>
<p>Himari’s handler is Thaddeus Cole. He has no real friends, just colleagues, such as Erastis Freyn (Marc's character).</p>
