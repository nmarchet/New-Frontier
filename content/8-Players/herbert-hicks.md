	<summary>Backstory | For the DM and the character's player only</summary>
	<p>Dakota’s father, Thomas, served as a guard for House Velyra. After the War of the Houses, when the Sovereign Mercantile Council sentenced the house and all of its retainers to exile and the Judgment of Thalasson, Thomas was forced aboard Mercy's Wake. As a guard, Thomas didn’t make the cut for Azure Crest, the largest and most seaworthy vessel of House Velyra’s doomed convoy. But that was a stroke of luck: Mercy's Wake along with Golden Wave survived passage through the Seas of Chaos, whereas Azure Crest is presumed lost along with Lord Aric Velyra himself, nearly all of his blood relatives and his senior staff.</p>
	<p>In Whakatāne, Thomas was hired by Captain Elias Thorne, co-chair of the provisional council established by the survivors, to help keep order in the nascent colony. Later, he became one of Whakatāne’s first deputies under Sheriff Mariah Drayton. Thomas instilled a strong sense of right and wrong in young Dakota. He passed from an illness in 1862, but he lived long enough to see Dakota follow in his footsteps as a deputy sheriff.</p>
	<p>Dakota’s mother, Martha, was a lady’s maid for Lord Aric’s niece before the house’s exile. In Whakatāne, she took a job as a housekeeper and server at the newly built Settlers’ Rest Inn in Fairhaven. That’s where she met Thomas. He caught her eye while she was serving him a meal, and the rest is history. Dakota was born early in their marriage. Martha instilled in him a sense of caring for those less fortunate. She is still alive and living in Fairhaven.</p>
	<p>In the sheriff’s service, Dakota received his nickname from Mason Loomis, another deputy who was as close a friend as Herbert ever had. Mason claimed Dakota means “friend” in the highlands of Falora back in Meredosia. Dakota uses his nickname exclusively; he refuses to respond to his given name.</p>
	<p>Dakota was a good deputy sheriff—fair, restrained and effective. He knew it and so did Sheriff Drayton. So he was shocked to hear the People’s Council had voted to reassign him to Gendron’s Post, a brand new and still unincorporated settlement, where the council had no authority. Orders are orders, but these never sat right with Dakota. They felt political.</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, he said goodbye to Mason and made his way south.</p>
	<p>In Gendron’s Post, Dakota was restless. With no authority in an unincorporated settlement, there was precious little he could do to fill his days. Eventually Jane Gendron, the settlement’s founder, gave Dakota a job guarding the town well. Today, Dakota can usually be found leaning back in a chair with his feet kicked up on the aforementioned well, polishing his fathers old pistol, Tribunal.</p>
	<p>Recently, Dakota has found a new purpose watching after a young woman, Ella "El" Wilson Pascal, whose family was massacred.</p>
