	<summary>Backstory | For the DM and the character's player only</summary>
	<p>Ella "El" Pascal Wilson was born on Whakatāne. Her mother, Sarah, and her father, Henry, worked in service to Lord Aric Velyra as a laundry maid and a dishwasher, respectively, at his country house in southern Rosslyn. They weren’t even in Bessemer for the War of the Houses. Nevertheless, the Sovereign Mercantile Council was looking to make an example, and anyone even remotely associated with House Velyra was swept up for exile and the Judgment of Thalasson.
<p>When the surviving exiles made landfall, Sarah and Henry were among the first to venture inland to make their own way. They claimed a homestead several day’s travel south, outside what would become Gendron’s Post some 30 years later.</p>
<p>For years, they were alone out there, where the desert meets the fertile plains—and they loved it. It was true freedom. They survived and flourished out there by their own efforts, by their own choices, and not by the whims of some lord or gang of unelected cronies. And, their farm was unusually bountiful. None of the other homesteaders who filtered into the region could match their yield.</p>
<p>Ella and her older brothers, Jake and Thomas, born here in this paradise her parents created. She was loved and cherished and completely unaware of the darker realities of the outside world. She grew up and met a man, Pedro Pascal, on one of her first runs to Gendron’s Post to sell produce to the caravans passing through to Kapma, Glendale and beyond. He was a miner, who hated to be underground and wanted to be in the sunshine. Ella noticed him one day as he seemed to be admiring a small patch of nature and sunshine. They had a couple of friendly run ins, during which Pedro impressed Ella with his ability to be masculine without being afraid to be vulnerable. One day, she invited him back to the homestead, and he never left. Their friendship became a true love.</p>
<p>They married and lived happily on her parents’ farm. Pedro took Ella's last name because it was a name of standing in the town. And, she also took his last name as a middle name out of respect for him.</p>
<p>Then, one day, raiders came from the south. Driving their hadrosaurs hard, they peeled off the road from Kapama and swarmed the homestead. They killed animals, burned crops and murdered Ella’s parents, brothers and Pedro.</p>
<p>Ella was clearing irrigation trenches in the back field. She smelled the smoke before she saw it. She came running back to the house, having to take long detours to avoid the rapidly shifting fire line. Everything was ashes and ruin. The house, the barns: all husks. Her parents and brothers were nowhere to be seen. She tried and failed to avoid imagining them burning alive in a barricaded house. When she saw Pedro’s body, she collapsed at his side and clutched him, desperately shaking him, trying to wake him up.</p>
<p>Dakota Hicks found her there hours later. He had seen a pillar of smoke all the way from Gendron’s Post and followed it. Ella was kneeling in the blackened courtyard surrounded by charred buildings. Everything was covered in ash, including Ella. She was staring into nothing, oblivious to everything except Pedro’s head, which she still cradled in her lap while she absently stroked his hair.</p>
<p>Eventually, Dakota was able to get Ella up and moving. He helped her bury Pedro’s body, gather up the few resources that survived the fires and brought her back with him to Gendron’s Post. Before she left, Ella strapped on Pedro’s gun belt and slipped his shotgun into the custom holster he’d designed. To this day, she is never without that belt. She calls the shotgun "Pascal." She also has a monogrammed handkerchief (EWP) that she keeps tied around her right wrist.</p>
<p>Ella doesn’t talk much, and most permanent residents of Gendron’s Post know her story, so they give her space. When she’s feeling up to it, Ella works as an apprentice blacksmith at the repair shop in town.</p>
<p>A few months after the massacre, Ella learned some farmers from Kapama were trying to work her parents’ old homestead. She didn’t know for sure these farmers were associated with the raiders who killed her family, but they sure as hell had no right to that land.</p>
<p>Ella began making nighttime runs to her old homestead. She salted the earth and set livestock loose. She did everything she could to make sure the once-bountiful land her parents and brothers tended would never be a going concern again. Sometimes Dakota would follow her out and help. The first time Ella invited Dakota to help was a test. He passed.</p>
<p>Today, the old Wilson farm is considered cursed land, tainted by the evil done there.</p>
