	<summary>Backstory | For the DM and the character's player only</summary>
	<p>Erastis is a distant relative of Lord Aric Velyra, the last head of House Velyra. He wasn’t yet born when the Sovereign Mercantile Council sentenced House Velyra and all of its retainers to exile and the Judgment of Thalasson. His father, Ulysses Freyn, and his mother, Amaranth Freyn, were forced aboard Golden Wave, and the small coastal sloop was driven out to sea, into the band of hurricanes to the south known as the Seas of Chaos.</p>
	<p>They both survived the passage, though many didn’t.</p>
	<p>When the exiles made landfall, Ulysses and Amaranth cut all ties to the reviled name of Velyra. Afterall, the majority of those who made it to Whakatāne were retainers of House Velyra, not direct family members, and most felt unjustly dragged into exile. What’s more, Ulysses was burdened with the guilt of his actions as a traitor who fed information to the Sovereign Mercantile Council. Hatred of House Velyra may be common now, but Ulysses’s actions back in Rosslyn to hasten the family’s fall did, in some way, lead to this exile. So, Erastis’ parents did their best to leave their previous life behind and adopted new identities for the new land.</p>
	<p>A year later, Amaranth gave birth to Erastis. However, his childhood was not a happy one. Even with the unusual abundance that greeted the settlers of Whakatāne, the early days of the colony were hard. Just two years later, Amaranth fell ill with a wasting disease that left her bed bound for months before she passed. So, Erastis was brought up by a grief-stricken father who kept him alive, sheltered and fed him, but was too grief-stricken to really raise a child.</p>
	<p>Instead, Erastis grew up wild, roaming the muddy roads and alleys of the rapidly growing settlement of Fairhaven with other similarly unattached children. Then, as a teenager, Erastis learned about his father’s role in the War of the Houses. For the first time, he felt the same shame, anger and a dozen other warring emotions that had left his father broken. His days on the streets took a troubling turn. He began stealing—from people, from businesses. His temper was on a hair trigger, and every day he found a fight or a fight found him. His father never noticed the bruises.</p>
	<p>One day, Erastis tried to pick the wrong pocket. It belonged to Paulic Sossei, an agent of the Haven Syndicate. He saw something in Erastis, something he could mold, and he gave Erastis the chance to repay his effrontery by working for the Syndicate. Erastis was good at it, and the work distracted him from his turmoil over his father. He began to quickly rise through the ranks.</p>
	<p>That’s the way it went until Erastis met Elena. He didn’t know she was his cousin at first. She was just a face that seemed oddly familiar, that he never could place. It was maddening. Eventually, he introduced himself, and they became fast friends. Later they discovered their mutual familial ties to House Velyra.</p>
	<p>Erastis became very protective of Elena. Elena herself and her work gave Erastis a purpose he’d been missing, and he threw himself fully into it. Over time, they concocted a scheme where Panacea employs Erastis, through the Syndicate, as a bodyguard for Elena. The arrangement works and still holds today, but Erastis’ rise in the Syndicate has fallen off sharply as he refuses all jobs that aren’t protecting Elena. Today, Elena staffs the Panacea clinic in Glendale, and Erastis is right there with her.</p>
