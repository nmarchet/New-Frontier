	<summary>Backstory | For the DM and the character's player only</summary>
	<p>Elena is a distant relative of Lord Aric Velyra, the last head of House Velyra. Her father, Hercules Valyra, died fighting in the War of the Houses, the civil war among Rosslyn’s great families that ultimately led to her family’s exile. She was only five years old when the Sovereign Mercantile Council sentenced House Velyra and all of its retainers to exile and the Judgment of Thalasson. With her mother, Calanthus Valyra, Elena was forced aboard Mercy’s Wake, and the small coastal sloop was driven out to sea, into the band of hurricanes to the south known as the Seas of Chaos.</p>
	<p>They both survived the passage, though many didn’t.</p>
	<p>When the exiles made landfall, Elena and her mother cut all ties to the reviled name of Velyra. Afterall, the majority of those who made it to Whakatāne were retainers of House Velyra, not direct family members, and most felt unjustly dragged into exile. So, Elena and her mother left their previous life behind and adopted new identities for the new land.</p>
	<p>Elena’s mother joined Panacea soon after the organization was created. She passed her knowledge of herbology on to Elena. Her mother’s death just after Elena turned 23 was a significant loss, but it solidified a resolve to continue her mother’s legacy.</p>
	<p>Today, Elena staffs the Panacea clinic in Glendale, where she provides medical care to locals and those passing through. Her skills are highly valued, and her reputation as a healer has grown over the years. Elena periodically joins Grace Tuttle, a former Panacea botanist who runs the Forager’s Hut, on expeditions into the Ironwood. She has discovered several previously unknown new medicines on these excursions.</p>
	<p>While she enjoys her work and finds purpose in it, Elena often finds herself overwhelmed by a sense of injustice. She can’t shake thoughts of “what if” and “why not.” And, when she follows the chain of causality and blame back to the Sovereign Mercantile Council, she dreams of revenge. She found the resistance movement that emerged when the Wayfinders’ Union arrived at Whakatāne and the possibility of returning to Rosslyn suddenly wasn’t so far-fetched. Elena periodically attends house meetings and maintains connections with key resistance figures—including a romantic connection with Rowan Mercer, the lead propagandist of the resistance.</p>
	<p>Elena is almost never seen without her cousin, Erastis Freyn. After an unlikely meeting, they became fast friends and later discovered their mutual familial ties to House Velyra. Erastis works for the Haven Syndicate, but they’ve managed to arrange for Panacea to employ Erastis as a bodyguard for Elena—much to the detriment of his career in the Syndicate.</p>
