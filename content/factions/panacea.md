Panacea was founded by a group of idealistic healers, botanists and scholars who were dismayed by the prevalence of fraudulent medicine sellers who exploited settlers' desperation in the first years of the colony. They aimed to bring scientific rigor and ethical practices to the field of medicine in Whakatāne.

The guild’s primary mission is to catalog and study the unique plant and animal species of the island, discover new medicinal properties and develop effective treatments. A significant focus of their work is to create a comprehensive pharmacopeia of Whakatāne.
