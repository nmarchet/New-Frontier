The former mercenaries, bounty hunters and lawmen among House Velyra’s retainers founded the Haven Syndicate. They saw an opportunity to provide structured protection services in the lawless and often dangerous frontier of Whakatāne. As settlements grew and conflicts arose, the demand for security only increased.

Today, the Syndicate is also known for less savory activities like intimidation, sabotage and “fixing” problems for clients willing to pay the right price. Their clients have ranged from individuals to business interests to the government at Fairhaven itself.

The Syndicate is organized by lines of business, each headed by a senior partner: risk management, conflict resolution, investigation, asset reclamation, strategic destabilization and narrative adjustment. These partners coordinate operations within their line. Common resources like their extensive network of informants are shared across divisions, allowing them to act swiftly and mobilize in nearly every settlement and stratum of Whakatāne society.

Loyalty to the Syndicate is paramount. Any betrayal by employees or other associates is met with severe consequences.
