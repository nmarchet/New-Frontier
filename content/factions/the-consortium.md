The Consortium wields significant influence over Whakatāne's key industries—fishing, mining and lumber. They leverage that influence to weaken the central government’s control and to establish more laissez-faire economic policies that favor their interests. Their aggressive business practices have put them at odds with Fairhaven's work to foster free and fair competition in the markets.

It is organized as a board of directors representing influential business leaders from the island's major industries. A chief executive officer manages day-to-day activities. Then there are the staff who do the actual work lobbying and negotiations.

The Consortium has been known to contract with the Haven Syndicate to pursue less scrupulous tactics when traditional influence and persuasion have failed.
