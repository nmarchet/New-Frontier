Some survivors interpreted their ordeal in the Seas of Chaos as exactly the divine test that the Sovereign Mercantile Council made it out to be. They believed they were judged pure by Thalasson and spared for a higher purpose, reinforcing their commitment to the [Elemental Trinity](elemental-trinity).

Eccentric street preachers can be found in most settlements passionately calling for a return to traditional faith, reminding passersby that all here are Thalasson’s Chosen. They rail against the new spiritualism that many settlers have adopted. Their fiery sermons often attract attention, both positive and negative.

This aggressive rhetoric is another source of social and political tension in Whakatāne. There is fear among government officials that adherents could become more organized and militant.
