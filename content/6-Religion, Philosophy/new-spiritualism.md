When the remnants of House Velyra made landfall on Whakatāne, they encountered an environment so different and bountiful that it felt like providence. They found unique flora and fauna that played crucial roles in their survival. It was as if the land itself was trying to sustain them. That feeling of personal intercession was something most had never experienced with the [traditional faith of the Trinity](elemental-trinity.md).

As the survivors-turned-settlers began to thrive and not merely survive, many of them leaned into this new feeling. They began to offer prayers and thanks to the immediate, tangible world around them—mountains, rivers, forests and even individual plants and animals. The settlers came to believe that their continued survival and prosperity depended on maintaining a harmonious relationship with the spirits that must inhabit the natural world.

The new spiritualism quickly integrated into daily life in the colony. Community gatherings often included rituals and ceremonies to honor spirits of the land. Festivals to celebrate the cycles of nature, such as the changing of seasons or significant weather events, reinforced the connection between the people and the spirits.
