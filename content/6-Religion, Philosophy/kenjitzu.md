# The Three Tenets
1. **Rei.** Respect, especially for the enemy, even in the face of adversity.

2. **Yu.** It is better to have the courage to try and fail than to be afraid to try at all. It is a combination of valor, fortitude, awareness and perceptiveness.

3. **Gi.** Rectitude means doing what is right. Right is most obviously found in service, and it is defined by one's master. Without a master, one can find right on one's own, but it is a narrow path and easy to stray from.
