Back in Rosslyn, most folks continue to follow a tradition of worship centered on the Elemental Trinity and the Triadic Scriptures. Some people in Whakatāne still do too. Glennon is the god of earth; Caelus is the god of air; and Thalasson is the god of the seas. 
# Time of Miracles
According to the gospel, the Trinity arrived on Glenbour from another realm. They divided the world among themselves and worked in harmony to create a place where mankind would thrive—crops grew abundantly, storms were calmed and the seas teemed with fish. 

Priests call this the Time of Miracles, and it was marked by harmony and prosperity. The Trinity's presence was felt in every aspect of life, and their guidance was directly evident in the daily lives of the people. Temples were erected in their honor, and rituals were performed to seek their continued favor.

> 1. In ancient days, the sky was split asunder, and the Three entered from realms beyond the veil.
> 2. Glennon, the earthshaper, seized the mountains and valleys as his own domain. 
> 3. Caelus, the skywarden, spread her wings over the heavens, claiming the winds and clouds. 
> 4. Thalasson, seaguard, her embrace of the oceans and rivers, filled them with life.

# The Blastphemy of Avarion
However, the scriptures tell of an obsessive recluse, known in the gospel as Avarion the Ambitious. Driven by an insatiable desire for knowledge and control, Avarion sought to harness the divine powers of the Trinity.

In this time, the gods walked among people, and Avarion followed them, always watching. When he wasn’t watching, he was practicing. Every gesture, every utterance that accompanied a miracle, Avarion recreated countless times, watching himself in a polished brass serving platter.

And then, one day, something in Avarion changed, and he knew. 

He took up a knife and slashed it across the palm of his hand. He set down the knife, took a deep breath and recreated gestures he’d seen Thalasson do countless times. Avarion’s fingers flowed through the movements, each as inevitable as the next wave. Then, he spoke a word of the divine language that he’d heard countless times. His chest thrummed as he breathed out, and his tongue danced to shape the syllables he spoke. Blood stopped flowing from the deep gash in his hand. Then, it started retreating back into his palm. Then, skin stitched itself back together without a trace of a scar.

*The blastphemy of Avarion ended the Time of Miracles.*
# Divine Schism
The Trinity felt Avarion’s working. Glennon was enraged by the audacity of a mortal daring to claim their power. His rage shook the foundations of the earth, causing massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

Caelus and Thalasson tried to calm Glennon, but his fury was too great, and they had no choice but to confront him. A devastating battle shook the very foundations of Glenbour. Glennon, seeking to turn the fight in his favor, dragged the three of them deep into the earth where he was strongest.

*Deep underground Caelus and Thalasson fought to subdue Glennon.*

Underground, Caelus and Thalasson struggled to contain the destruction of Glennon's rage. In a desperate bid to protect the world from ruination, Caelus and Thalasson combined their powers to seal Glennon away. But Glennon, in a final act of defiance, ensured that they would be trapped beneath the earth too.

> 22. But Avarion, in his pride, dared to wield the power of the gods. 
> 23. Glennon’s wrath shook the earth, and Caelus and Thalasson strove to contain him. 
> 24. Yet Glennon, in his fury, dragged them beneath the ground, where his power was greatest. 
> 25. There, amidst the roots of the mountains, the gods did clash, and the world quaked. 
> 26. Desperate Caelus and Thalasson combined their might to seal Glennon away, and he, in turn, bound them with him. 
> 27. Thus, the time of miracles had passed, and the Three were sealed in the depths, for the sake of mankind.

# Crisis of faith
The ordeal that the survivors of House Velyra endured and their sense of betrayal by the traditional faith of the Elemental Trinity led most to seek [new spiritual explanations](new-spiritualism.md) for their survival and the bountiful new land that they now call home.

However, in Rosslyn, nothing has changed for the majority of people who still follow the traditions of the Trinity. Farmers still offer prayers to Glennon for fertile soil; sailors make offerings to Thalasson for safe voyages; and everyone looks to Caelus for favorable weather.
