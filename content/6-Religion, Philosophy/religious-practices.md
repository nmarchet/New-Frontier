# New Spiritualism
## Rituals
* **Renewal of the Hearth.** Four times a year, at the changing of the season (March 20, June 20, September 20 and December 20), settlers gather to honor the spirits of this land who protect the people's homes, hearths, and families. Each community builds a central fire, and community members bring embers or small pieces of ash from their personal hearths to symbolize the unity of family and community. Charcoal from the fire is later distributed to each home to maintain the spirits' connections to each family's hearth.

* **Festival of the Spirits.** This large, communal event celebrating the spirits of the land, rivers, mountains is held at the end of the harvest season, on November 1. All a community's settlers  set out bread, wine, milk, fruits and herbs on altars constructed from natural materials as a sacrifice to the spirits. The festival itself usually features dancing, music and ritual plays that tell the story of how the spirits saved the first settlers.
