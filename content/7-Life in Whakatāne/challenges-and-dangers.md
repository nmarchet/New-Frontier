# Discovery by Rosslyn
Rosslyn is a looming threat for the Whakatāne colony—especially in the minds of those who weren’t born on Whakatāne and survived the Judgment of Thalasson imposed by the Sovereign Mercantile Council. 

If the existence of Whakatāne became widely known, the survival of even the smallest remnant of House Velyra would be an unacceptable threat to the stability of Rosslyn. Afterall, the Council rules—as every decree proclaims—“[b]y the grace of the Divine and the mandate of Prosperity ….” The House’s survival would throw that divine mandate into doubt, and every malcontent faction would seize the opportunity to press their advantage.

So, Rosslyn would need to respond, but what form would that response take?

- Rosslyn might send military forces to occupy the new settlements.
- Maybe Rosslyn would restrict Whakatāne colonists to the island to ensure no word gets back to the homeland.
- Settlers might be forcibly relocated to make way for people from Rosslyn, with Rosslyn's citizens given preferential treatment over the original settlers.
- Perhaps Rosslyn would ruthlessly exploit the natural resources of Whakatāne and degrade the environment beyond repair.

It could be any of these or a combination of them or something else entirely. In any case, Whakatāne would not be in a position to resist Rosslyn.
# The Scour
The Scour is the name folks have given to the extreme winds that occasionally drive down from the Shards and tear across the plains and desert regions south of Fairhaven. These powerful winds turn loose dust and debris into a deadly and prolonged abrasive blast.

They have only happened twice in the colony's history: first in year 18 (1842 DE), and then again in year 31 (1855 DE). Each time, the devastating force of the Scour caused tremendous damage and wiped out fledgling independent settlements all along its path. Now, no one settles in what has come to be known as the Scour Barrens.

The Scour may very well have a natural cause. Certainly scientists from the Wayfinders’ Union who have heard of the phenomenon think it does. However, most Whakatāne citizens believe that the Scour is caused by furious spirits of the island who are upset by the settlers' presence or by something they’ve done. Some go as far as to perform rituals to appease these spirits in an attempt to prevent future occurrences.
# The Unknown
Who knows what dangers could lurk for explorers who delve into the vast unexplored regions of Whakatāne. No matter what settlement you call home or which stratum of society you occupy, odds are you’ve had more than a few conversations turn to conjecture about what we might find in the blank place on maps. 

Here are some popular theories:

**Treacherous Terrain.** Hidden chasms, unstable rock formations, quicksand or dense, impenetrable forests.

**Carnivorous Plants.** Aggressive plant species that trap or poison those who venture too close.

**Predatory Animals.** Large, undiscovered predatory creatures, like giant reptiles, venomous snakes or large hunting cats.

**Invasive Species.** Creatures that have no natural predators, rapidly multiplying and consuming local resources.

**Diseases.** New illnesses to which settlers may have no immunity.

**Spirits.** Malevolent spirits or guardians reacting violently to intruders.

**Hostile Tribes.** Isolated tribes of indigenous people defending their territory fiercely against perceived invaders.

**Lost Settlers.** Descendants of previous expeditions that went missing in the Seas of Chaos, now surviving in a feral state, attacking anyone they encounter out of desperation or madness.
