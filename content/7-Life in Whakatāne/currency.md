At the time of their exile, the unwilling colonists of Whakatﾄ］e had no money. 

Why would they?

House Velyra and all of its retainers were meant to drown in the raging storms at the heart of the Seas of Chaos, and the great families of the Sovereign Mercantile Council didn't get rich by throwing money away.

However, they survived and made landfall. The colony of Whakatﾄ］e quickly became a thriving society, and a society needs money. When the mines in [Scotsglen](scotsglen) proved out, the [People's Council](the-peoples-council) in Fairhaven began minting their own currency.

* The smallest copper coins are called cents. 
* The silver coins are called stones. Each stone is worth 10 cents.
* The gold coins are called wheels. Each wheel is worth ten stones.

Despite the rich lodes unearthed in Scotsglen, precious metals are still a limited resource in Whakatﾄ］e. As a result, the Council also issues bills in larger denominations of wheels (25-, 50- and 100-wheel bills). For truly extravagant transactions, many merchants draft checks from a bank in [Port J](port-j).
