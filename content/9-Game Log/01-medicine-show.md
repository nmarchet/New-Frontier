---
# Day 4 (1 Oct. 1864)

## Morning
* Elena and Erastis encounter Daniel McArdle, a very happy man skipping down the road to Gendron’s Post. He is a former and future customer of Dr. Horne’s, who’s tonic apparently cured his genital warts.
* Elena puts McArdle to sleep with a narcotic sedative, because he won’t hold still.
* Ella returns to work for a second day in a row to help Stone make some bridle bits for the foreman at the staging yard.
## Midday
* Elena and Erastis arrive from [Glendale](glendale). Hicks notices them come into town.
* Ella checks in with Hicks. She’s noticed him keeping tabs on assorted people around town, but Hicks doesn’t clue her in on what’s going on yet.
* Ella heads to the Rusty Spur for some sarsaparilla.
* Elena and Erastis drop off the unconscious fan of Dr. Horne’s tonic at the Panacea clinic.
* They talk with the healer there, Eliza Brooks.
* She is very insistent that Dr. Horne is a menace, a huckster and that he’s going to get people hurt.
* They decide to get a sample of the tonic for testing as a first step of the investigation.
## Afternoon
* Himari arrives from Fairhaven. Hicks notices him come into town.
* Elena and Erastis make their way to the crowd around Dr. Horne down by the general store.
* Himari finds Elena and Erastis. He recognizes Erastis and follows them to the crowd waiting to buy Dr. Horne’s tonic.
* Elena buys a vial of the tonic for a stone and 5 cents.
* Meanwhile, Dr. Horne shouts to his assistant, Lila, for more stock. 
* Erastis follows Dr. Horne’s assistant to the tack room of the staging yard. She continues through into the equipment corral where caravanners store their wagons and coaches.
* Himari follows Erastis and posts up outside the staging yard tack room.
* Hicks has been watching Elena, Erastis and Himari and senses there might be trouble. He has the bouncer of the Rusty Spur fetch Ella to join him. They watch the developments at the staging yard from just outside the Rusty Spur.
* The tack room is occupied by the staging yard proprietor, Darren Smithson, and Erastis makes the strategic decision to inquire about boarding the hadrosaurs he and Elena rode in on instead of continuing to follow Lila.
* Ella decides to get closer. She runs over to the repair shop and grabs the last batch of bridle bits from Stone and uses the delivery as cover to head into the staging yard tack room and to try to pickpocket Erastis.
* Erastis notices Ella’s attempt, but before he can say anything, Ella makes a scene and yells at Erastis for crowding her.
* Ella rejoins Hicks in front of the Rusty Spur.
* Horne’s assistant, Lila, comes back into the staging yard tack room from the equipment corral and leaves carrying a good-size box.
* Himari greets Erastis as Erastis leaves the staging yard tack room.
* Elena, having purchased a vial of Dr. Horne’s tonic, rejoins Erastis in front of the staging yard office. Erastis introduces Himari.
* On her way back to Dr. Horne, Lila is stopped by a man raving in the street.
* He grabs her by the shoulders and is shouting at her about how everyone is going to die.
* Everyone—Ella, Hicks, Erastis, Himari and Elena—witnesses this, as well as the bouncer for the Rusty Spur.
* Ella and Hicks react first. 
	* Ella throws a knife at the man, hitting him in the shoulder.
	* Hicks grabs the man and slams him to the ground, restraining him until the fight goes out of him.
	* Ella retrieves her knife.
* The bouncer picks up the man and throws him away from the Rusty Spur, taking care of the situation as far as he’s concerned.
* Ella, Hicks, Erastis, Himari and Elena check on Lila to make sure she’s OK.
* Erastis offers to carry Lila’s box for her, but she isn’t parting with it. Dr. Horne wouldn’t approve.
* Lila returns to Dr. Horne and restocks his sales case.
* In the meantime, the raving man has wandered off.
## Late afternoon
* Elena and Hicks go to the Panacea clinic to test the tonic.
* Himari, Ella and Erastis look for the raving man.
* There is a trail of blood drips, and the three of them follow the path of the man where he stumbled erratically along the street and then made his way around back of the staging yard corral where wagons and coaches are stored.
* The three follow the trail into the staging yard corral.
* Ella peels off to talk to Darren Smithson in the tack room.
* Darren hasn’t really noticed anything unusual except for Dr. Horne’s medicine show. He agrees to keep an eye out for anything odd and let Hicks know if he sees something.
* Himari and Erastis find the raving man, who seems much calmer now.
* The man is clearly experiencing some sort of post-traumatic stress crisis. His speech is largely incoherent. Among other things, he says:
	* “You’re ghosts walking around, and you don’t even know you’re already dead.”
	* “I’ve wandered the forgotten paths, witnessed the sacred fire, seen the signs hidden in shadows.”
	* “The blasphemy is not forgotten, not forgiven.”
	* “He is coming to reclaim what’s his, and no one will be spared.”
* In moments of clarity, Himari and Erastis are able to find out:
	* Whatever encounter the man had was in mountains to the south, beyond even where ambitious homesteaders have pushed the colony boundaries.
	* The man has tried to warn people in other settlements—including in [Kapama](kapama), the agricultural center to the south.
	* No one believes him. He’ll probably try in Fairhaven next.
* Himari and Erastis head back out toward the clinic.
* Ella comes back into the equipment corral and finds Dr. Horne’s wagon. It’s a bright red, purple and green affair with gold lettering on the side. There is an extraordinarily strong lock on the door at the back of the wagon.
* Ella tries to pry open the lock, but it doesn’t budge.
* Ella goes and finds Himari and Erastis as they are crossing the road back to the clinic.
* She convinces them to come try to open the wagon with her. Erastis attempts to pick the lock, but he too is unsuccessful.
* Ella heads back to the Rusty Spur for a beer.
* At the clinic, Eliza and Elena have been testing the tonic sample:
	* It has an aromatic botanical smell.
	* It seems to be a tincture of some part of a plant or tree.
	* Assaying the sample, Elena finds it comparable to—albeit much weaker than—some of the healing drafts Panacea produces.
* Elena shares her results with Eliza.
* Eliza is very upset that Elena is letting Dr. Horne’s misdeeds go unpunished.
* Elena tells Eliza not to worry, that they will “handle” Dr. Horne, introducing air quotes for the first time in this world.
* Eliza is confused about what bunny rabbits have to do with anything, but Elena assures her they are going to hurt Dr. Horne.
* Hicks excuses himself, because he can’t hear this talk.
* Eliza is satisfied for now, but indicates that people are going to get hurt, and she’ll have to do something if Elena won’t.
* Elena wakes up McArdle, the satisfied customer,and has him drink her sample. Then she makes him strip down to show her his warts.
* Though the warts remain, there don’t seem to be any ill effects of the tonic, and McArdle reports the pain is fully alleviated. He immediately heads out to buy more tonic. 
## Evening
* Ella, Hicks, Erastis, Himari and Elena meet up outside the clinic.
* Hicks helps Erastis, Himari and Elena sort out sleeping accommodations for the night, and Himari makes arrangements for his hadrosaur as well.
* Elena wants to send an update back to Panacea headquarters in Fairhaven, so they stop by the watchtower that also houses the local ‘dactyl loft.
* After some negotiation with Jane Gendron’s ward, a 12-year-old boy named Eliot, Elena is able to report back regarding the relatively innocuous nature of the tonic and requests guidance on how to proceed. It may be a day or two before a response comes back.
* Ella, Hicks, Erastis, Himari and Elena head to the Rusty Spur for dinner.
* There, they discuss the mission that Elena, Erastis and Himari are on for Panacea.
* Hicks surreptitiously shares the message he received from Sheriff Drayton with Ella.
* Himari steps away, goes to buy a dose of the tonic and returns. He drinks it down and feels pretty good, like some long standing aches and pains have been slightly alleviated at least temporarily.
## Late evening
* Erastis sees Dr. Horne enter the Rusty Spur.
* Dr. Horne finds a seat near the door on the other side of the dining room from Ella, Hicks, Erastis, Himari and Elena.
* After some time, Lila joins Dr. Horne, but she doesn’t sit.
* They seem to be having a heated argument.
* Erastis heads over to talk to Dr. Horne. He reaches the table in time to hear Lila say, “Well I guess we’ll see,” before she storms out of the tavern.
* Dr. Horne is fairly taciturn until Erastis buys him a beer.
* Sufficiently lubricated, Dr. Horne is happy to talk about how proud he is of his tonic and how glad he is to be able to help people. He goes on about all the different injuries and ailments it can help. However, he won’t talk about how it’s made or where he gets the ingredients.
* Over the course of the conversation, Erastis realizes he recognizes Dr. Horne. There was a forager back in Glendale named Zeke who just disappeared one day a year-and-a-half to two years ago. It was the source of some talk around the settlement at the time, but that quickly faded.
* Ella leaves dinner to check on her parents’ old farm, which is about a 45 minute walk away. Everything is as it should be: dead and abandoned.
* Erastis rejoins his colleagues at dinner and shares his revelation.
* Eventually, Hicks, Erastis, Himari and Elena retire to the rest house for the night.
* Ella camps out in her usual spot overlooking her family farm.

# Day 5 (2 Oct. 1864)

## Morning
* Hicks, Erastis, Himari and Elena wake up and start their day.
* Hicks heads over to the repair shop to let Stone know not to expect Ella today.
* Hicks heads over to his post at the well.
* Eliot calls down from the watchtower to Hicks that he saw something interesting last night.
* After some negotiation, Hicks pays Eliot 2 stones.
* Eliot tells Hicks that he saw a rider racing out of Gendron’s Post toward [Sand Lake](sand-lake) just before dawn. He was able to get the spyglass up just in time to recognize the distinctive hadrosaur with the long curved crest on the back of its head as the one that was pulling Dr. Horne’s wagon.
* Erastis, Himari and Elena head out of the rest house and realize that no one is in front of the general store; Dr. Horne and his usual crowd of customers are gone.
* Erastis, Himari and Elena head to the staging yard.
* They manage to pry up enough boards to get into Dr. Horne’s wagon and find the body of Horne’s assistant.
