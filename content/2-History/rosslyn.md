Rosslyn, a small island nation off the coast of Meredosia, has quietly emerged as the stable economic center of a continent often plagued by conflict. Its strategic location along major maritime trade routes has made it an indispensable hub for commerce. Strategic neutrality, and sophisticated diplomacy allow Rosslyn to quietly control regional trade while avoiding the pitfalls of war.
# Significance of the Sea
Today, Rosslyn is an economic power, but first it was a country of fishers, shipwrights and weavers. One of the main exports of Rosslyn is still a fine thread spun from the fibrous seaweed that covers the seabed for miles around Rosslyn. It’s tied into nets for fishing, twisted into cord for ships’ rigging and woven into tacky, water repellent cloth that’s used to make the ponchos that are so popular with seafaring people all across Meredosia.

# Rooted in Religion
The very identity and governance of modern Rosslyn are rooted in an apocryphal story of the [Elemental Trinity](elemental-trinity). Rosslyn—specifically a large rock outcropping in the market district in the capital city of Bessemer—is supposedly where Glennon, Caelus and Thalasson first set foot on Glenbour and claimed their respective domains of land, sky and sea. It’s the event from which the Meredosian calendar is reckoned (divine era/pre-divine era). The oldest temple in Rosslyn was built around that rock, which has been worn smooth by the hands of hundreds of thousands of pilgrims who wanted to feel close to the divine.

Nearly everyone in Rosslyn professes belief in the Trinity. For many, it’s a sincere and very literal faith. They believe the narratives of the Triadic Scriptures actually happened. The lessons within aren’t poetic parables; they’re specific directives on how to live a good life. Others simply draw spiritual strength from the stories but don’t turn to them as any kind of an accurate history.

Still others perform faith publicly for the social benefit. A skeptical observer of Rosslyn politics might point to the nation’s government officials as a prime example of such cynical lip service. Nine representatives from Rosslyn’s wealthiest and most powerful families sit on the Sovereign Mercantile Council that controls trade and appoints all local officials. Its members are considered divinely sanctioned and are functionally the highest ranking clerics in Rosslyn. All Council decrees begin with the phrase, “By the grace of the Divine and the mandate of Prosperity, it is so ordered ….”

# The Sovereign Mercantile Council
For more than 300 years, the great families have ruled Rosslyn. These rich and powerful merchant dynasties began as small, enterprising families who capitalized on the island nation’s strategic location. Centuries ago, Rosslyn was a modest collection of fishing villages and small ports. During a period of political instability and fragmented rule, these families began to accumulate wealth through shrewd trading, seafaring prowess and the exploitation of local resources.

As their wealth grew, the families worked to consolidate their power. Through negotiation, bribes and coercion, they secured exclusive trade rights from early rulers of Rosslyn—including monopolies over certain goods, such as spices, silk and precious metals.

The great families parlayed that economic dominance into political authority.

They financed local leaders and infrastructure projects to earn favor and influence. Strategic marriages with prominent families and nobility helped cement their status and integrate them into the political elite. Gradually they gained control over key institutions—the judiciary, local councils, regulatory bodies and more—to enact and enforce laws that favored their interests. Investing in cultural and religious institutions, they built temples, funded festivals and patronized the arts. This patronage enhanced their image, allowed them to sway public opinion and brought them moral authority.

The culmination of their power was the formation of the Sovereign Mercantile Council. This council, composed of the heads of the leading merchant dynasties, became the governing body of Rosslyn. They justified their rule through a veneer of piety and civic duty, claiming divine favor and the mandate of prosperity.
# The Exile of House Velyra
Forty years ago, the political equilibrium of Rosslyn was shattered by House Velyra, one of the most prominent and influential families with a seat on the Sovereign Mercantile Council. Spying, secret deals, hostile takeovers and more are normal among the great families, however House Velyra went far beyond accepted custom.

In an effort to secure a complete monopoly on the spice trade, Lord Aric Velyra sanctioned unprecedented bribery and blackmail operations that undermined the Council’s integrity and threatened the balance of power among the oligarchs. But, open hostilities only broke out after a foiled attempt on the life of Lady Eveline of House Marquet and the subsequent investigation that revealed an ongoing scheme of targeted assassinations.

At an emergency meeting, the Council unanimously voted to take decisive action. Even exile was not enough: House Velyra would receive the Judgment of Thalasson.

After the decision, violence erupted in city streets all across Rosslyn as mercenaries of House Velyra warred with those of the other families. Warehouses were set ablaze, ships were sabotaged and city markets became battlegrounds. Weeks of intense conflict ended at last when a coalition of rival families besieged the Velyra estate. Overwhelmed and outmaneuvered, Lord Velyra was captured.

The Council stripped House Velyra of its assets and seized its properties. Then, the last head of House Velyra, the entire extended family and all of its retainers were forced aboard three ships that were left to them: a coastal brig, Azure Crest, and two sloops, Mercy’s Wake and Golden Wave. These ships were provisioned with only token stores, and, while seaworthy, none of them were intended for deepwater traversals.

Nevertheless, on Sept. 18, in the year 1824 of the divine era, a fleet of Council galleons escorted the three coastal vessels south to the Seas of Chaos and drove them into the band of hurricanes that rage there perpetually. Witnesses aboard the Council fleet saw the exiles scattered by wind that tore at their rigging and waves that overtopped the smaller ships. Even one of the Council galleons, Grand Horizon, failed to break free of the storms and was lost as the fleet turned about.

The Judgment of Thalasson is brutal and decisive and does not come without a cost.
