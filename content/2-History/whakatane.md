On Sept. 18, in the year 1824 of the divine era, a fleet of galleons under flag of Rosslyn's Sovereign Mercantile Council set out to impose the Judgment of Thalasson on the last head of House Velyra, the entire extended family and all of its retainers.

They escorted House Velyra's three coastal vessels south to the Seas of Chaos and drove them into the band of hurricanes that rage there perpetually. Witnesses aboard the Council fleet saw the exiles scattered by wind that tore at their rigging and waves that overtopped the smaller ships. Even one of the Council galleons, Grand Horizon, failed to break free of the storms and was lost as the fleet turned about.

But, of course, the judgment—if, indeed, there was any divine intervention at all—wasn’t exactly what the Council expected.

Two ships, Mercy’s Wake and Golden Wave, came out the other side of the Chaos. They were the first ships ever to survive the passage. There was no sign of Azure Crest, the largest vessel of House Velyra’s doomed convoy. It was presumed lost along with Lord Aric Velyra himself and nearly all of his blood relatives. 

Behind the surviving ships, storms of the Chaos still raged on the distant horizon, but the ocean here was calm. Overhead, feathery clouds drifted peacefully in front of the red sun in a pale tangerine sky. The survivors patched together makeshift sails out of the tattered sheets and hoisted them aloft on the spars and lines that weren’t torn free and swept overboard in the passage. 

Gradually, cries of seagulls filled the air, and a sailor on Mercy’s Wake cried out, “Land ho! Straight on our heading.” Three hundred thirty nine souls gathered on deck and laid eyes on the island that they would come to name Whakatāne for the first time.
# Settlement and Survival
The survivors beached Mercy’s Wake and Golden Wave on an island in what would come to be called the Salas River delta. With the loss of Azure Crest, very few blood relatives of House Velyra made it to Whakatāne. So, there was a shared sense of injustice and adversity among the new settlers who felt unjustly dragged into exile, and that fostered a strong community spirit.

The settlers established the City of Fairhaven at the delta with a provisional council. Led by Captain Elias Thorne of Mercy’s Wake and First Mate Anara Greaves of Golden Wave, the council coordinated the initial efforts to secure food, water and shelter. The ships were quickly scrapped for building materials. (Even today, it’s not unusual to find a tavern or inn that claims to have an original spar or deck plank from the ships.)

Out of necessity, the settlers adapted quickly to hunting, fishing and foraging. They learned to utilize local flora in medicines and even made use of the unusual fauna native to the island, including enormous plant-eating lizards that they called [hadrosaurs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560844-hadrosaurus). 

Hadrosaurs ran wild in packs through the head-high grasses of the nearby plains, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. But—when a young woman named Betsy Danforth found an abandoned egg, hatched it and raised it—the settlers found that hadrosaurs could be trained to carry a rider or pull a plow.
# Expansion and Exploration
With the basics of survival addressed, the provisional council sent out exploratory missions to map the immediate surroundings. These missions discovered fertile plains, dense forests and mineral-rich mountains where new settlements were established to take advantage of the natural resources:

* In the fertile grasslands between the Vein River and River Romul, **Kapama** became the agricultural center of the colony.
* On the other side of the Shards, loggers in **Glendale** provided much needed lumber for the rapidly expanding colony.
* **Scotsglen** grew up around the camps at the foot of the Shards that processed the iron ore and granite from the mines there.
* Later, miners established **Port J** west of Fairhaven, where the Shards meet the shoreline. It’s an ideal location from which to move the ore and stone coming out of Scotsglen.

# Growth and Development
Over time, roads, trains, telegraph lines and even pigeon-size messenger lizards called pterodactyls connected the new outposts, and the individual settlements began to function together as a single, cohesive colony.

The provisional council evolved into a more structured government in Fairhaven with representatives elected from each incorporated settlement. The new People’s Council appointed the colony’s first sheriff, Mariah Drayton, to maintain law and order. Her deputies make regular patrols of the incorporated settlements.

Pioneering homesteaders still push out into the unexplored Wilds for a bit of land to call their own. There is safety in numbers, so even more settlements emerged—Sand Lake and Gendron’s Post being the latest. Many people living in these outposts hope for official recognition from Fairhaven, while some business interests instead work to keep the territories unincorporated to avoid the scrutiny of Fairhaven’s sheriffs.

In Port J, a new business collective known simply as the Consortium began emulating the sharp practices of Rosslyn's great families. They allied with interests in Glendale and Scotsglen to control key industries and began to challenge Fairhaven’s primacy.
# The Outside World Encroaches
Eight years ago, in year 32 of the settlement of Whakatāne, a large, well-maintained galleon sailed into the harbor of Port J. It was flying the compass rose flag of the Wayfinders’ Union. A determined captain, Elara Windrider, had set out on an ambitious mission to circumnavigate the Seas of Chaos. Against all odds, she and her crew succeeded, making them the first outsiders to reach Whakatāne since the exile of House Velyra.

Overcoming their ingrained suspicion of anything from Rosslyn or the old world, People’s Council members traveled to Port J and met with Captain Windrider. Negotiations were tense but ultimately fruitful. In the end, they reached an agreement: Whakatāne would export its resources—timber, ore and the island’s unique medicinal plants—in exchange for advanced tools, technologies and manufactured goods from the Union.

The Union also agreed to keep the existence and location of Whakatāne secret and to provide protection against external threats, including potential pirate activity. In return, Whakatāne allowed the Union to establish a small, fortified trading post near Port J, where Union merchants and representatives could operate.

Despite the reassurances of secrecy from the Union, many in the colony feared that word of Whakatāne’s existence would reach Rosslyn nonetheless. However, those voices were drowned out by those fixated on the potential for growth and development, and a formal agreement was signed. 
# Conflict Within
**The Consortium opposes Fairhaven.** The economic landscape of Whakatāne has grown complex. The Consortium in Port J has significant influence over the island's key industries—fishing, mining and lumber. They continue to leverage that influence to weaken the central government’s control and to establish more laissez-faire economic policies that favor their interests. Their aggressive business practices have put them at odds with Fairhaven's work to foster fair competition.

Tensions escalated as the Consortium began to exert political influence. They attempt to bribe Council members, fund opposition candidates and manipulate public opinion through propaganda campaigns.

And, they have been successful. In their most prominent victory to-date, the Consortium managed to block a Council initiative to build a new railway line connecting Fairhaven to Glendale and Scotsglen. Council members saw this project as essential for the equitable distribution of resources and fostering economic growth across all settlements. The Consortium viewed it as a direct threat to their control over the island's industries.

**The resistance movement.** The arrival of the Wayfinders’ Union renewed contact between Whakatāne and the outside world. For some, this brought back memories of the exile and the harrowing passage through the Chaos. A small but vocal movement has begun advocating for revenge against Rosslyn and the oppressive regime that cast them out.

Despite their passionate rhetoric, the resistance movement struggles with a lack of concrete plans. Nevertheless, it is yet another source of tension in present day Whakatāne.
