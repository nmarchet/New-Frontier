# Reports of odd behavior in remote settlements
[Adventure 01](01-medicine-show-DM)

Over the last two or three years, [Sheriff Mariah Drayton](mariah-drayton) has noticed a concerning trend in the reports she receives from her traveling deputies. Each year has seen more accounts of unusual shifts in behavior—sudden aggressive and violence outbursts.

Thousands of years ago, Glennon, Caelus and Thalasson—mythological gods of the Elemental Trinity faith, but also real beings—had their [final conflict](elemental-trinity#divine-schism). It took place deep below what's now Whakatāne. In the end, Caelus and Thalasson combined their powers to seal Glennon away. But Glennon ensured that they would be trapped beneath the earth too. 

The mutual seals aren’t perfect: Thalasson and Caelus were able to create and sustain the endless hurricanes of the Seas of Chaos in an effort to keep people away from Whakatāne. Similarly, Glennon’s influence seeped out into the land of Whakatāne. For hundreds of years, his tendrils of malevolence grasped at nothing. But recently, even through the haze of the seals, Glennon felt the nauseating presence of people again stepping upon his domain. He began influencing their behavior to sow unrest as he did once more than a thousand years ago in a different, more remote part of the island.

This is the source of the trend the sheriff has noticed in her reports.

In Gendron’s Post, the healer, Eliza Brooks, and the vagabond, Carson Grundy, are affected by Glennon’s influence.
# The Syndicate's underhanded tactics
[Adventure 02](02-beast-tall-grasses-DM)

Sheriff Mariah Drayton dispatches her newly formed irregular unit—the players—to investigate something wrong in the idyllic, rolling hills surrounding Kapama. 

For months, small animals—cats, dogs, the occasional goat—had been going missing periodically. Then it was cattle. Folks began barn feeding their hadrosaurs instead of letting them loose to graze freely out in the pastures. Most recently, a farm hand has gone missing.

In the outskirts of Kapama, out among the tall grasses, people have found signs of a large, unidentified predator: strange tracks, mangled carcasses and even purported eyewitness accounts. It has all created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty in the heartland of Whakatāne, but the impact is being felt everywhere as food production slows dramatically.

Unbeknownst to the players there are several ties to their backstories.

The Consortium in Port J has been looking to reestablish trade and influence with Rosslyn ever since the Wayfinders' Union arrived in Whakatāne and reconnected the island with the outside world. 

* They began smuggling some of Whakatāne's unique goods out on Wayfinders' Union ships as samples and bona fides to establish trade and relationships with one or more of Rosslyn's great families.

* They hired the Haven Syndicate to do whatever ruthless dirty work is necessary to procure the goods they were smuggling.

* Some years ago, they used Syndicate mercenaries to take over the farm belonging to the family farm of Ella "El" Wilson Pascal. They raided the farm because they wanted the unusually bountiful crops and medicinal plants that only grew in the necessary quantity and quality under Ella's parents' watchful eyes. When Ella's parents refused to take part in the smuggling operation, they attacked and murdered Ella's parents and husband.

* Kimari's father, Daisuke, found out that the Syndicate was doing this work (specifically the attack on the Wilson family farm) on behalf of the Consortium. Before he could expose them, though, he "accidentally" died on a mission—or rather they murdered him.

* These same raiders are partially responsible for the disturbances around Kapama. They captured a real beast that was in the area. The escalations—the stealing of hadrosaurs (to feed to the beast) and the murder of a man who got too close to their operation—were the raiders, however.
