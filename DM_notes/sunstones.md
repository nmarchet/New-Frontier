Sparkstones ([á la Dinotopia's sunstones](https://dinotopia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunstones)) are brilliant, hexagonal crystals found deep under the Shards. They are the results of Glennon's efforts to escape his prison. The tremendous energies involved have imbued crystals deep under the mountain range with unique properties.

The stones are incredibly hard. The crystals are vividly opalescent, but seem to come in three varieties, each marked by a dominant color.

* **Power sparkstone.** This is the most common variety. It is sea green and produces a piezoelectric effect when exposed to sunlight.

* **Transmitter sparkstone.** This is the other relatively common variety. It is orange-yellow colored and seems to store sunlight and release it slowly in a diffuse glow.

* **Ruby sparkstone.** This is the most recently discovered, and there are only a handful of samples. Some of the crystals closest to Glennon's influence are a deep red—almost black. No one knows what other property they might have—but, for some reason, they glow brightest *away* from sunlight. (DM's note: ruby sparkstones magnify the dark desires in anything they touch, human or machine.)
